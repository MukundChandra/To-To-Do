### 1. Introduction to Project

This is a pet project for me to make a sort of Memo keeping software. It will keep Small Notes,To-Do Lists,Schedule Charts and display them at the startup. I've always lacked the determination to keep track of every commit that I make and I always forget them eventually. 

This project is something which helps me in two ways :
1. It helps me learn a new language C#.
2. It helps me to make a proper schedule for stuff and making sure I dont forget them.

PS : If you're wondering why the title has one more To, go watch Steins;gate!
